                            <p>
                                Learning GRE words is easier now! WordNinja offers a mnemonic way of learning with all details at one stop.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WordNinja allows users to learn English words interactively and provides a platform to memorize words with custom learner key. 
                                This app is built, especially for students aspiring to achieve good Verbal scores in the GRE examination. The only challenge which stops students from cracking high score is the vast range of unfamiliar words. Being a student, I have faced similar difficulties. Thus, to tackle this, I designed this app that combines all the information about the word, including the simple meaning, dictionary meaning, synonyms, antonyms, related words.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>To memorize the word quickly. I have added useful features such as :
                    mnemonics - memory keys or incidents in daily life 
                    mnemopic - pictures related to the word so that its screenshot fits into the brain
                    learner - words are grouped in a set of 30 to ease the students for setting the goal for a day/week for learning the words
                </p>
                <p>More importantly, this app allows users to edit the mnemonic and add his/her memory learner and also offers to change the picture associated with the word.

                    Packed with high-frequency words, this app is very effective and will surely give you the results if used regularly.
                    
                    I will continue to add more features like a personal account, video related to the word, and many more as per your request. Make sure to like the app and give your honest comment to motivate us to serve you the best for free forever.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Enjoy the app :)

                        Pro. AKI will not take responsibility for.
                        Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
                        active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                        provided by your mobile network provider, but
                        Pro. AKI cannot take responsibility for the
                        app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                        access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data

                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                        may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data

                        or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
                        accepting responsibility for any such charges, including

                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is

                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. Pro. AKI does not promise that
                        it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
                        may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
                        use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
